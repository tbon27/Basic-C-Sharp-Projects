This repo is dedicated to the Basic C# Projects I have completed through The Tech Academy's C#/.NET Bootcamp coursework.

## Projects
* [Casino Game: Twenty One](https://github.com/tbon27/Basic-C-Sharp-Projects/tree/main/TwentyOne)
* [Car Insurance Quote App](https://github.com/tbon27/Basic-C-Sharp-Projects/tree/main/Assignments/CarInsurance)

### Casino Game: Twenty One

### Car Insurance Quote App
This project is an MVC web application that functions as a car insurance website. The app takes in user input on policy information and calculates a quote based on business logic. I have also added an admin page that allows staff to view all of the quotes that have been issued.
