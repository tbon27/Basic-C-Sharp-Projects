### Welcome to my Car Insurance Quote Application repository!

The purpose of this repository is to store my project files for the Car Insurance Quote project.

- This project is an MVC web application that functions as a car insurance website. The app takes in user input on policy information and calculates a quote based on business logic. I have also added an admin page that allows staff to view all of the quotes that have been issued. This project was completed as coursework for The Tech Academy's C#/.NET Software Developer Bootcamp.
