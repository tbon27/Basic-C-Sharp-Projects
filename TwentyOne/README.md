### Welcome to my Casino Game: Twenty One repository!

The purpose of this repository is to store my project files for the Casino Game: Twenty One project.

- This project is a console application that allows a user to play the popular casino card game Twenty One. Users can enter unique information such as name and the amount one desires to bet per hand. The game functions with basic traditional rules with hit and stay options, while the dealer stays on hands 17+. The structure of this application is also prepared for an update to multi-game casino application if desired. This project was completed as coursework for The Tech Academy's C#/.NET Software Developer Bootcamp.
